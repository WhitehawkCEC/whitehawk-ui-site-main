          Personal Information About Customers That WhiteHawk Gathers:
        </strong>
        The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and
        continually improve your WhiteHawk experience. Here are the types of
        information we gather.
      </p> <p class="font-body text-base font-normal leading-7 tracking-wide p-4 text-gray-500"><strong class="text-gray-800">Information You Give Us:</strong>
        We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give
        us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain
        information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many
        of our features. We use the information that you provide for such
        purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping
        for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you.
      </p> <p class="font-body text-base font-normal leading-7 tracking-wide p-4 text-gray-500"><strong class="text-gray-800">Automatic Information:</strong>
        We receive and store certain types of information whenever you
        interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies,"
        and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser
        accesses WhiteHawk.com or advertisements and other content served by
        or on behalf of WhiteHawk.com on other Web sites.
      </p> <p class="font-body text-base font-normal leading-7 tracking-wide p-4 text-gray-500"><strong class="text-gray-800">E-mail Communications:</strong>
        To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive
        a confirmation when your open e-mail from WhiteHawk if your computer
        supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists
        received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending
        unnecessary messages to our customers.
      </p> <p class="font-body text-base font-normal leading-7 tracking-wide p-4 text-gray-500"><strong class="text-gray-800">Mobile:</strong>
        When you download or use apps created by WhiteHawk or our
        subsidiaries, we may receive information about your location and your
        mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. We may
        use this information to provide you with location-based services, such
        as advertising, search results, and other personalized content. Most
        mobile devices allow you to turn off location services.
      </p> <p class="font-body text-base font-normal leading-7 tracking-wide p-4 text-gray-500"><strong class="text-gray-800">Information from Other Sources:</strong>
        We may receive information about you from other sources and add it to
        our account information.

          Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to
          enable our systems to recognize your device and to provide features
          that are intended to enhance your browsing and purchasing
          experience.
        </p> <p class="font-body text-base font-normal leading-7 tracking-wide text-gray-500">
          The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your
          browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify
          you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies
          altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data
          used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the
          add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer.
          Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of WhiteHawk.com
          essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on.

          We share customer information only as described below.
        </span></div> <p class="font-body text-base font-normal leading-7 tracking-wide p-4 text-gray-500"><strong class="text-gray-800">Third-Party Service Providers:</strong>
        We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our
        behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages,
        sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from
        customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance,
        providing search results and links (including paid listings and
        links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer
        service. They have access to personal information needed to perform
        their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
      </p> <p class="font-body text-base font-normal leading-7 tracking-wide p-4 text-gray-500"><strong class="text-gray-800">Affiliated Businesses:</strong>
        We work closely with affiliated businesses. In some cases, such as
        Marketplace Vendors, these businesses operate stores at WhiteHawk.com
        or sell offerings to you at WhiteHawk.com. In some cases, we may
        operate stores, provide services, or sell product lines jointly with
        these businesses. You can tell when a third party is involved in your
        transactions, and we share customer information related to those
        transactions with that third party.
      </p> <p class="font-body text-base font-normal leading-7 tracking-wide p-4 text-gray-500"><strong class="text-gray-800">Promotional Offers:</strong>
        Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of WhiteHawk customers on
        behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that
        business your name and address.
      </p> <p class="font-body text-base font-normal leading-7 tracking-wide p-4 text-gray-500"><strong class="text-gray-800">Business Transfers:</strong>
        As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores,
        subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer
        information generally is one of the transferred business assets but
        remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy
        Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in
        the event that WhiteHawk, or substantially all of its assets are
        acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets.
      </p> <p class="font-body text-base font-normal leading-7 tracking-wide p-4 text-gray-500"><strong class="text-gray-800">
          Protection of WhiteHawk and Others:
        </strong>
        We release account and other personal information when we believe
        release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our
        User Agreement and other agreements; or protect the rights, property,
        or safety of WhiteHawk, our users, or others. This includes exchanging
        information with other companies and organizations for fraud
        protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does
        not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing
        personally identifiable information from customers for commercial
        purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy
        Notice.
      </p> <p class="font-body text-base font-normal leading-7 tracking-wide p-4 text-gray-500"><strong class="text-gray-800">Your Consent:</strong>
        Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information
        about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity
        to choose not to share the information.

        Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all
