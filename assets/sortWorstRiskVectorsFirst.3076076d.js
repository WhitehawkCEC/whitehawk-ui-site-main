Though these events do not necessarily result in direct data loss to you, the relevant interruptions to business continuity can be used to make informed decisions to improve your security preparedness."},{name:"System Patching",text:"System Patching risk vectors evaluate how vulnerabilities affect how many systems in an organization's network infrastructure and how quickly the company resolves any issues."},{name:"Application Security",text:"Application Security risk vectors track security holes and liabilities introduced by out-of-date or unsupported server software and business applications. These vectors also track outgoing communications from desktop devices including metadata about the device's operating system and its browser version. WhiteHawk compares that information with currently released versions or software updates available for those systems."},{name:"Communications Encryption",text:"Communications Encryption risk vectors analyze server configurations to determine if a server's security protocol libraries are correctly configured and supporting strong encryption when making connections to other machines. Incorrect configurations may make servers vulnerable to POODLE and Heartbleed attacks that can lead to attackers obtaining sensitive data. WhiteHawk checks TLS/SSL connections with servers and collects the certificate chain during the session negotiation process, allowing us to review and establish which hosts need updating."},{name:"Email Security",text:"Email Security risk vectors track the use of SPF, DKIM and DMARC DNS records. SPF on its own isn't enough to prevent domain name spoofing. Email has two possible \u201CFrom\u201D Address Fields (Envelope From, Header From.) SPF checks are done on the Envelope From, so it's not a preventative measure against all spoofing. Legitimate services do use this approach, for example, newsletters, but it is also used in spoofing. DKIM and DMARC both seek to get around this vulnerability. DKIM signs the email with a signature that a recipient server can verify against the Published DNS record. DMARC is used in conjunction with SPF; it aims to match the Header From domain name with the Envelope From used during the SPF check."},{name:"User Behavior",text:"User Behavior risk vectors focus on employee activities that may introduce risks into an organization's networks.
