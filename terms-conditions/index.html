      WhiteHawk’s proprietary open analytic approach to understanding the
      cyber risk landscape globally, tracking threat vectors that impact each
      Public and Private Sector, and mapping to discoverable risk activity
      being experienced by a specific organization or company result in a
      current (and therefore dynamic) cyber risk profile based upon vetted and
      published risk standards and frameworks (including, but not limited to
      the Center for Internet Security [CIS]/National Institute of Standards
      and Technology [NIST]/Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification
      [CMMC]). All identified risk data sets, impacting a specific company or
      organization with a uniquely registered internet domain address, are
      then prioritized and mapped to key areas of focus and potential risk
      mitigation options, in a tailored and easy to understand and actionable
      Cyber Risk Scorecard. In addition, these risk analytics are mapped to
      innovative and impactful vendor solution options (these are not
      recommendations), which have been vetted for potential effectiveness,
      ease of implementation and affordability. But the purchaser makes the
      final selection and concludes the sale.
